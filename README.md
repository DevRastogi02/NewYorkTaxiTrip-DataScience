# Taxi Trip Duration Prediction using XGBoost

This project uses machine learning to predict the duration of taxi trips in New York City, leveraging various external factors such as traffic patterns, weather conditions, and time of day. The model was developed using **Python** and the **XGBoost** algorithm to optimize predictions and improve operational efficiency for taxi services.

## Key Features

- **Modeling with XGBoost**: Developed a predictive model to estimate taxi trip durations based on historical data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Enhanced prediction accuracy by incorporating external factors such as:
  - Weather conditions
  - Traffic patterns
  - Time of day
- **Data Preprocessing**: Addressed challenges such as missing data and outliers by:
  - Using **data imputation** techniques for missing values.
  - Applying **outlier detection** methods to ensure the model's robustness.
  
## Performance Improvements

- **Accuracy Enhancement**: Achieved a 15% improvement in model accuracy over baseline models.
- **Real-World Impact**: Improved route planning and operational efficiency for taxi services, potentially reducing trip duration and costs.
